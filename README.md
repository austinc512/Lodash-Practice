## Build a simple terminal app that uses at least 5 lodash methods.

1. Use fake data or APIs you have worked with in previous projects or google fake data you can use. - [ ] Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.
2. Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.
3. Use at least these methods: _.chunk(), _.reverse(), _.without(), _.shuffle().
4. Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.
